# Arenal Data Model
[Arenal](https://awp.skyware-group.com/) is a cloud service for secure and reliable exchange of laboratory orders.
This package is the official API data model (DTO classes).

If you use the official web client, you do not need this package as a dependency, as client library already includes it. Use it only if you implement your own client library. Note that this package is a "single source of truth" whereas Arenal service depends on it too.
